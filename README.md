# Digital Freedom Center - Bihar

An initiative by [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org/)

Starting in Bettiah, West Champaran, this project aims to establish Digital Freedom Centers across Bihar, creating peer-to-peer learning hubs that focus on digital skills using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), critical thinking, and English language proficiency. Our mission is to prepare students for future opportunities in the software/IT industry through practical, industry-relevant education using exclusively FOSS tools and technologies, with a commitment to inclusive participation (~50% female representation).

## Core Philosophy

1. **FOSS-First Approach**: All training and development uses Free and Open Source Software exclusively
2. **Community-Driven Learning**: Students learn and teach each other in a peer-to-peer environment, supported by industry mentors who guide them through real-world FOSS projects
3. **Bilingual Progression**: Start in Hindi, gradually transition to English through immersive learning
4. **Project-Based Learning**: Learn by doing, focusing on real-world applications with open source solutions
5. **Inclusive Participation**: Striving for ~50% female representation in the program
