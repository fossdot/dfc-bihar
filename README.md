# Digital Freedom Center - Bihar Tech Education Initiative

This project establishes Digital Freedom Centers across Bihar, creating peer-to-peer learning hubs that focus on digital skills, critical thinking, and English language proficiency. Our mission is to prepare students for future opportunities in the software/IT industry through practical, industry-relevant education, with a commitment to inclusive participation (~50% female representation).

## Core Philosophy

1. **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: Students learn and teach each other, fostering leadership and communication skills
2. **Mentorship-Driven**: Industry professionals guide students through real-world projects
3. **Bilingual Progression**: Start in Hindi, gradually transition to English through immersive learning
4. **Project-Based Learning**: Learn by doing, focusing on real-world applications
5. **Inclusive Participation**: Striving for ~50% female representation across all programs
